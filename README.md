# local-weather
A weather GUI made with Tkinter GUI framework. To use this, install **requirements.txt** by running:

```
pip install requirements.txt
``` 

Incase that doesn't work, try:

```
py -m pip install requirements.txt
```

Make sure to include your authoritisation (api key) in the variables from following websites
> stormglass.io
> ipstack.com

The code automatically detects your aproximate location from your IP address ( I don't store it ) and gives the weather in your area.
